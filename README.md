used some pictures from https://www.shutterstock.com/search/cat-observed?dd_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F and https://www.vets4pets.com/pet-health-advice/cat-advice/kitten/introducing-kittens-to-adult-cats/

idk how to credit them.

currently practicing flexbox and box model, i've align them using flexbox, didnt use flex shrink, flex grow and flex basis because it achieve the same and i thought it was unnecessary.

used min-height vh to fit the content exactly to the viewing height of the monitor. 

separated the contents of the css so its managable and readable to other devs. 

put some comments to the html to navigate easily.
